## Inspiration💡

Do you know that It will take 108 years to close the gender gap as the recent Global Gender Gap report? So our team wants to do a project that could help decrease this 108 years. The other inspiration is, around the world, the achievements of women are being celebrated on International Women’s Day which began back in 1911. But it's always sad that it's only one day in a year. We want to make this happen every day. We want to create a platform for women and girls to share their stories of any kind either anonymously or using their Gmail.

## What it does 🖥
We made a web app specifically for women to share any thoughts, struggles, issues, and achievements with other women. Our platform will allow people to sign in with google or anonymously and share their thoughts. We think that most women who face issues might want to stay anonymous to share the things they have been through. But once they are comfortable with their thoughts they can use their email account and share their thoughts.

## How we built it ⚙️
To make this project we used: how We used ReactJS, Tailwindcss, and Firebase to make this full-stack application. We have used the tailwind config to bring the dark and light mode, it also can adjust it based on your system. For the backend we used Firebase. Using Firebase we were able to have two auth methods anonymous and Gmail. The other thing we used is the firestore database to store the images and the chats.

## Challenges we ran into 🎢
We had problems implementing firebase cloud functions for bad words limit. The other problem was hosting the project on GitHub pages. It was built using react+firebase and that made it somewhat tricky to host it on ghpages. However, we fixed all the issues and hosted it on GitHub.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We used tailwindcss for the styling and we are proud of using it. We are also happy to use GitHub for hosting. We also have used every feature of GitHub available.

## What we learned 📚
We learned about emoji mart, how to work with firebase images, tailwindcss and even though we couldn't implement it we learned a lot about twint and other ways to scrape data from Twitter API.

## What's next for iCan ✈️
Due to time, we couldn't automate the scraping of the Twitter bot and it's now working manually. We want to fully automate that and make it post to the chat in a few hours. The other option we couldn't add is a reply section.
